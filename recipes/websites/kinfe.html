            <strong>Culinary Tips for Making Gulab Jamun:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Ensure the dough is neither too dry nor too sticky. Adjust the amount of milk accordingly to achieve a smooth and pliable consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Uniform Size:</strong> Roll the dough balls to a uniform size to ensure even cooking. This ensures that all Gulab Jamun balls cook at the same rate and absorb the syrup uniformly.</li>
                <li><strong>Low and Slow:</strong> Fry the Gulab Jamun balls over low heat to ensure they cook evenly from the inside without getting burnt on the outside. This slow frying method results in a golden brown color and a soft texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> Maintain the temperature of the oil at a constant level. Fluctuating temperatures can affect the texture and appearance of the Gulab Jamun.</li>
                <li><strong>Syrup Absorption:</strong> Allow the Gulab Jamun balls to soak in the sugar syrup for an adequate amount of time. This allows them to absorb the sweetness and flavor of the syrup fully.</li>
                <li><strong>Syrup Consistency:</strong> The sugar syrup should have a slightly thick consistency to coat the Gulab Jamun evenly. Simmering the syrup for the right amount of time ensures the perfect texture and consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor Infusion:</strong> Enhance the flavor of the sugar syrup by adding aromatic ingredients such as crushed cardamom pods, saffron strands, or rose water. These ingredients impart a delightful fragrance to the Gulab Jamun.</li>
                <li><strong>Garnish Creatively:</strong> Experiment with different garnishes such as chopped nuts, edible rose petals, or a sprinkle of edible silver leaf to add visual appeal and texture to your Gulab Jamun.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Gulab Jamun tastes best when served warm, allowing the syrup-soaked balls to melt in your mouth. Reheat them gently before serving if they have cooled down.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Tips:</strong> Store leftover Gulab Jamun in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Reheat them briefly in the microwave or steamer before serving to restore their soft texture and warmth.</li>
            </ol>

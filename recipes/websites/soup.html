        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="instruction">
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add salt to taste and the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, soak saffron strands in warm milk and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set aside for garnish.</li>
            <li>To the remaining onions in the pan, add ginger paste and garlic paste. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>
            <li>Add biryani masala and salt to taste. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, lamb, or beef pieces to the pan and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and add plain yogurt to the pan. Mix well to combine. Cook for a few minutes until the meat is cooked through and the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture in the pan. Sprinkle chopped coriander and mint leaves on top. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fried onions, chopped coriander, mint leaves, and sliced boiled eggs if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or salan (spicy gravy) on the side.</li>

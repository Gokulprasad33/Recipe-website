        <h1>Gulab jamun recipe</h1>
        
        <p> Gulab Jamun is a classic and beloved Indian dessert renowned for its soft texture and sweet, aromatic flavor. These delectable sweet treats consist of round, doughnut-like balls made from khoya (milk solids) or milk powder, flour, and a leavening agent such as baking powder. The dough is gently kneaded and rolled into small, smooth balls, which are then deep-fried until they achieve a golden-brown color.

            Once fried, the Gulab Jamun balls are soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup infused with cardamom and often flavored with rose water, imparting a delightful floral essence. This syrup bathes the Gulab Jamun, infusing them with sweetness and moisture, ensuring each bite is bursting with flavor and tenderness.
            
            Gulab Jamun is a staple dessert at festive occasions such as weddings, celebrations, and religious festivals like Diwali and Eid. It is typically served warm, allowing the syrup to envelop the soft balls, creating a heavenly indulgence that delights the senses.
            
            Whether enjoyed on its own or paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream, Gulab Jamun is a timeless dessert that never fails to satisfy the sweet tooth and leave a lasting impression with its irresistible taste and decadent texture.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee or melted butter</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons milk (or as needed to make a soft dough)</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>For the sugar syrup:</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>4-5 green cardamom pods, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rose water</li>
            <li>Saffron strands (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="instruction">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add ghee or melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and knead into a soft dough. The dough should be smooth and pliable.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls and roll them between your palms to make smooth balls. Make sure there are no cracks.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to low and carefully add the dough balls to the oil.</li>
            <li>Fry the balls on low heat, stirring gently and continuously, until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked from all sides. This may take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the balls are frying, prepare the sugar syrup. In a separate saucepan, combine sugar, water, and crushed cardamom pods. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 5-7 minutes until the syrup slightly thickens.</li>
            <li>Once the Gulab Jamun balls are golden brown, remove them from the oil and drain excess oil on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Immediately transfer the hot Gulab Jamun balls into the warm sugar syrup. Allow them to soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the sweetness and flavor.</li>
            <li>Garnish with saffron strands (if using) and serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature.</li>

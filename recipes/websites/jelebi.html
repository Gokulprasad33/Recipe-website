        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon plain yogurt</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron strands</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Ghee or oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol class="instruction">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and plain yogurt. Gradually add water while whisking until you have a smooth batter. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely. Once dissolved, add cardamom powder and continue to simmer the syrup until it reaches a sticky consistency. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer the fermented batter to a squeeze bottle or a piping bag fitted with a narrow tip. Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully squeeze the batter into the hot oil in circular motions to form spiral shapes. Fry the Jalebi until they are crisp and golden brown on both sides, flipping as needed. This process should take about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the fried Jalebi from the oil and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup, ensuring they are coated evenly. Allow the excess syrup to drip off before transferring them to a serving plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat the frying and dipping process with the remaining batter until all the Jalebi are cooked and coated with syrup.</li>
            <li>Garnish the Jalebi with slivered almonds or pistachios if desired, and serve them warm for the best flavor and texture.</li>
        </ol>
